In this tutorial, I will show you how to send email by using the [Nodemailer]() and [Gmail]() as the email provider. 

```ts
function greet(name: string) {
	console.log(`Hey ${name}! ðŸ‘‹`);
}
```

## Setup the Development Environment

Nodemailer is a Node.js module that prides itself as the solution most Node developers turn to by default for sending emails with Node.js and for good reason. It's pretty easy to set up nodemailer to start sending emails due to its features.

Most times, you would need a pretty quick way to start sending emails in your Node application when you're building for development and that's where Gmail comes in.

```bash
#npm
npm install nodemailer

#yarn
yarn add nodemailer
```
